# Graph-Based LLM Exploration

Welcome to my personal repository where I dive into the fascinating world of graph-based language models (LLMs) and graph databases like Neo4j. This space serves as my playground for learning, experimenting, and exploring how multi-agent systems interact with graph structures.

## About This Repo
This repository houses notebooks and projects that revolve around the intersection of LLMs and graph databases. Specifically, Iâ€™m focusing on concepts like:

* Graph-Based LLMs: Exploring how LLMs can utilize graph structures to represent knowledge, query data, and reason across nodes and relationships.
* Multi-Agent Systems: Investigating how multi-agent setups operate within graph environments, where each agent can represent a distinct node or task, with the ability to communicate and exchange information across the graph.
* Graph Databases: Working with tools like Neo4j and using Cypher query language to manage and query the graph, simulating how agents interact with dynamic knowledge graphs.
* LangGraph: Exploring its capabilities in integrating LLMs with graph databases to enhance decision-making and state management in multi-agent systems.

## Key Concepts Explored
* Graph Agents: LLM-based agents that operate over graph structures, with memory and state evolving as they traverse and query the nodes.
* State Management: Keeping track of an agent's knowledge and how it's updated as new information is retrieved from the graph.
* Querying with Cypher: Writing and optimizing Cypher queries to navigate and extract data efficiently from Neo4j databases.
